# Analyzing-Amazon-Data1
        How much money have I spent on Amazon? — That’s a question that will interest, and possibly terrify, longtime customers of the ecommerce giant. 
        This project will evaluate the following modelling approaches to analyze the amazon data. 
• Downloading and installing the Tools. 
• Downloading amazon order history data. 
• Open a Jupyter Notebook.
• Getting the data into pandas.
• Cleaning the data.
• Calculating the Total Amount of Money Spent on Amazon.
• Calculating Other Things like - Average Spend on Amazon, Biggest Purchase, Etc. 
• Calculating how much have I paid in Sales Tax. 
• Analyzing Amazon spending over time. 
        With this project, I have got some cool things like: 
❖ How much I spent on Amazon during this period.
❖ What my highest, lowest, and average order totals were.
❖ How much tax I paid, and the effective sales tax rate I paid.
❖ How my spending fluctuated over time. On which days I spent the most money.
